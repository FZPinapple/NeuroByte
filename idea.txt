Progression:
Startup Phase (Clean) – Just chips.

Efficiency Phase (Gray Area) – You use consumer data to optimize sales.

Manipulation Phase (Shady) – Neural ads, forced updates, user profiling.

Dominance Phase (Dark) – Mind-control tools, brain backups sold to corps, etc.

“Morality Meter” that drops based on your decisions.

Random events triggered by unethical behavior:

“Whistleblower emerges!”

“Activists protest your headquarters”

Optional “PR Cover-Ups” you can buy to mask scandals (further deepens the spiral).


Using Mines to create chip resources
Using Labs to research


Marketing:
Spend money to raise demand level:

Upgrades increase ad efficiency.

Risk/reward choice to crash market or disrupt demand:

“Heat” meter: If it gets too high, you may face consequences later (fines, news reports, protests).


Every machine, AI, and automation adds to your system load.

If the load exceeds your current infrastructure, production slows or glitches.

Upgrades like “Cooling Towers” or “Quantum Servers”

You can choose to overclock your servers for a short-term boost… at the cost of short-term damage.

NeuroByte Price is determined by public perception of your company.

Perception is influenced by:

Scandals (from sabotage or unethical tech)

PR campaigns

Global news events (random or triggered)

Buy tiered contracts for access to base and advanced materials.

Each tier provides a steady supply.

Unethical upgrades (e.g. child labor suppliers, war zone materials) cost less but hurt reputation.
